Project Name: Naruto Theme Network

The Naruto Theme Network is a project designed to explore the thematic relationships among Naruto episodes and characters. Using various Python libraries and tools, the project extracts data from Naruto subtitles and character information from the Naruto Fandom wiki. It then analyzes this data to identify relationships between characters and themes across episodes. The project ultimately visualizes these relationships as a network graph.

Web Scraping (Scrapy and BeautifulSoup):

Utilizes Scrapy and BeautifulSoup to scrape data from the Naruto Fandom wiki.
The BlogSpider class extracts information about Naruto jutsu (techniques) from the wiki, including names, types, and descriptions.
Scraping is done in a structured manner, following links and parsing HTML content.

Data Processing (Pandas and NLTK):

Pandas is used to organize and manipulate the scraped data, such as scripts from Naruto episodes.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is employed for text processing tasks, such as sentence tokenization and named entity recognition (NER).
NER identifies characters' names in episode scripts, which are crucial for understanding character relationships.

Named Entity Recognition (Spacy):

Spacy's NLP pipeline is applied to detect named entities, particularly characters, from episode scripts.
Named entities, such as character names, are extracted and utilized to establish relationships between characters.

Theme Classification (Transformers Pipeline):

Transformers library is used to create a zero-shot classification pipeline for identifying themes within episode scripts.
Themes such as friendship, hope, sacrifice, etc., are classified based on the content of the scripts.

Network Analysis (NetworkX and Matplotlib):

NetworkX is employed to create a graph representing relationships between characters based on their co-occurrence in episode scripts.
Matplotlib is utilized for graph visualization, displaying the network of character relationships in Naruto.

Interactive Visualization (PyVis):

PyVis library is used to create an interactive HTML visualization of the character relationship network.
The visualization allows users to explore the network graph and interact with character nodes.

Data Visualization (Seaborn and Matplotlib):

Seaborn and Matplotlib are utilized for visualizing the identified themes and their scores across episodes.
Bar plots are generated to represent the prevalence of different themes throughout the Naruto series.

Project Output:

The project outputs a comprehensive analysis of character relationships and thematic elements within Naruto episodes. This includes visualizations of character networks, thematic distributions, and interactive exploration capabilities. The final result provides insights into the complex narrative structure and thematic development of the Naruto series.
